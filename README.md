# cookapp
An application to help you handle cooking and shopping

## Applications architecture

The project consists of a FastAPI backend and a React TS frontend. The backend handles data management, user authentication, and business logic, while the frontend provides an interactive user interface for users to manage their recipes, ingredients, fridge inventory, and shopping lists.

It may be run locally using Docker and Docker Compose and also on GCP using Cloud Run and Cloud SQL.

## Application Functionalities

- **Fridge**: View and manage items currently stored in your fridge. You can see all fridge items, add new ones, and update quantities. Useful for tracking what ingredients you have available.

- **Recipes**: Browse, filter, and view recipes. You can see detailed instructions, add new recipes, and filter recipes by various criteria. This tab helps you discover and organize your cooking options.

- **Schedule**: Plan your meals for the week. Add dishes to your schedule, view recipes for each scheduled meal, and manage your weekly meal plan. This helps with meal prep and organization.

- **Shopping List**: Automatically generates a shopping list based on your scheduled meals. You can view, filter, and manage shopping items, and move purchased items directly to your fridge.

- **Ingredients**: View and manage all available ingredients. Add new ingredients, filter by category, and update ingredient details. This tab helps you keep your ingredient database up to date.

- **Login/Register**: Secure authentication for users. Login to access personalized features, or register a new account to start using the app.
